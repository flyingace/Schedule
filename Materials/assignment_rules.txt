No two shifts on the same day
No adjacent L&D shifts
No shift before or after L&D Night except 2nd L&D Night
All employees get 2 weekend L&D shifts over 3 months

Emps carry hours +/- from previous week of shifts
Available emp with lowest assigned/contracted ratio takes shift

Spread out nights and weekends
Some people like to have both shifts on the weekend
Some people like two or three nights in a row
Some people hate having two shifts in a row


Current date format is 01May2015_LD for May 1, 2015, L&D Day Shift. Should this change?

No two shifts on the same day
No adjacent L&D shifts
No shift after L&D Night except another L&D Night
    Does employee have a shift assigned that matches the date in the shift's shiftID
    OR a shift that matches the date from the previous day's LN shift

How do employee preferences play into this?


Proposed steps for auto-assign:
1. Get number of weekend shifts (5 x full weekends)
2. Get number of employees covering these shifts
3. Max number of shifts any employee can be assigned is Math.ceil(weekend shifts/# of employees).
4. Min number of shifts any employee will be assigned is Math.floor(weekend shifts/# of employees).

Randomly assign weekend shifts. Try to spread them out.
1. For each WE shift, loop through emps until all emps have minimum number of shifts, avoiding conflicts
2. For each remaining WE shift randomly select employees, avoiding conflicts, avoiding clustering? No employees have more than max shifts

employees with different #'s of hours
shifts of different lengths
conflicts that must be avoided
