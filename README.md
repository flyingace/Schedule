# Schedule
Schedule, which is only a working name, is the name of an application being built using ReactJS & the Flux framework. Ultimately the app will be used by the Midwifery team at Bellevue Hospital to sort out their complicated scheduling needs.

Please Note:
This, like most repos visible in this account, was a personal project largely intended for me to get a better handle on using React & Flux together. As such it is largely incomplete and probably quite rough.
